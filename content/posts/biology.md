This is a summary of the course [Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-biology-the-secret-of-life-3). 

# Molecular composition of cells
Atomic composition of life is pretty similar across all living organisms. At the level of atomic composition you are 
* 63% Hydrogen (H)
* 24% Oxygen (O)
* 10% Carbon (C)
* 1.4% Nitrogen (N)
* 0.2% Phosphorus (P)
* <0.1% Sulfur (S)
* Trace amounts of ions - Calcium, Chloride, Potassium, Sodium, Magnesium, Manganese, Selenius

# Covalent Bonds
Covalent bonds are shared pairs electrons between two different atoms.
There are different kinds of covalent bonds determined by how many pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms.
1. Single Bonds
2. Double Bonds
3. Triple Bonds

The strength of a bond is measured by how much energy it takes to break the bond (measured in $kcal/mol$).

Covalent bonds require around $80 \cdot kcal/mol$ to break.

The maximum number of covalent bonds each atom can engage in is:

| Atom       | Maximum Bonds   |
|------------|-----------------|
| Hydrogen   | 1               |
| Carbon     | 4               |
| Oxygen     | 2               |
| Nitrogen   | 3 (sometimes 4) |
| Phosphorus | 5               |
| Sulfur     | 6               |

* Sharing may not be equal - some nuclei of some atoms pull harder. Bonds in which electrons are shared equally are called *non-polar bonds* and bonds in which electron are not shared equally are called *polar bonds*.
* The bond is probabilisticly moving around, but not necessarily equally shared. The measure of how much an atom "pulls" on an electron is called *electronegativity*.
Oxygen and Nitrogen are much more electronegative than Carbon and Hydrogen. We may write:
$$O,N \gg C,H$$
* Covalent bonds don't break up at random.

# Non-Covalent Bonds
## Hydrogen Bonds
Molecules may be polar if they are formed by polar bonds. Molecules are like little magnets which some sides which a probabilisticly more / less charged. The negative sides of molecules can be attracted to the positive sides of other molecules. These form bonds which we call *hydrogen bonds*. 

These bonds are weaker than covalent bonds and require around $5 kcal/mol$ to break.

## Ionic Bonds
Ionic bonds are formed when electrons are completely transferred from one atom to another. It is usually formed between two oppositely charged ions (atoms with a net charge) or between two atoms of sharply different electronegativites.

## Van der Waals bonds
Van der Waals bonds are caused by correlations in the fluctuating polarizations of nearby particles.

## Hydrophobic forces
Imagine a glass of water which contains a lot of $H_2 O$ molecules which create hydrogen bonds between each other. If we put some non-polar molecules such as a hydrocarbons (oil) the water molecules have a harder time of orienting and have less translational and rotational entropy. The second law of thermodynamics states that processes tend to the least free energy (Gibbs energy). So the water and hydrocarbons will repell each other and eventually separate.

### Importance of studying non-covalent bonds
Although large molecules are held together by covalent bonds, their shape depend much less on covalent bonds and much more by hydrogen, ionic and van der waals bonds. They determine the shape in which long molecules fold.
